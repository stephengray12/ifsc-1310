        <h2>Dragon Project Revison and Reflection</h2>
    <p> The project overall looks pretty well. I noticed he did not put a way to get back to the top of the page.
        The pages looks pretty well layed out and the images look nice. I thought it was nice touch using the background images he did.
        I also noticed that the footer did not go all the way to the bottom so I would probably fix that. On the configurations I would probably
        add a css card effect. Then on the faq page I would an accordion effect. I would also add a hover effect on the buttons. </p>
    <p>
        So, when I first started this class I was worried I would fall behind due to the time commitment of having to work 40-60 hours a week at my job.
        I am 29 years old with two kids so going part-time was not an option. Overall, I think it went well. I definitley wish I had more time to commit to the class. I feel like I missed out on really 
        taking advantage of your knowledge. I did learn so much in this class especially with css. I have coded in the past, but css has always been my biggest weakness. I really enjoyed
        learning about css cards and jquery. They way you broke down positioning with css and how to target certain classes and ids with more specifity was super helpful.
        That was one area that always drove me crazy on personal projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        I feel like I did well with the html classes and with folder structure. I also feel like I did well with the css, but there is definitley room for improvement. The jquery
        was a little difficult for me, because I am use to writing vanilla js. If I could start over, I would try to have spent more time going through the resources you provided. I plan
        to go back and reference them for the future given there still available. I also would of tried to take off work to try and make the inperson classes.
